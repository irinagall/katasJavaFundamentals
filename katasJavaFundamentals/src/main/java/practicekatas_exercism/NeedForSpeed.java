/* NOT COMPLETED BECAUSE I CANNOT PASS TEST IN TASK3
* In this exercise you'll be organizing races between various types of remote controlled cars. Each car has its own speed and battery drain characteristics.

Cars start with full (100%) batteries. Each time you drive the car using the remote control, it covers the car's speed in meters and decreases the remaining battery percentage by its battery drain.

If a car's battery is below its battery drain percentage, you can't drive the car anymore.

Each race track has its own distance. Cars are tested by checking if they can finish the track without running out of battery.

You have six tasks, each of which will work with remote controlled car instances.
* Task 1: Allow creating a remote controlled car by defining a constructor for the NeedForSpeed class that takes the speed of the car in meters and the battery drain percentage as its two parameters (both of type int):


* Task 2:
* Task 3:
* Task 4:
* Task 5:
* Task 6:
